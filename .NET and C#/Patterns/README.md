# Design Patterns

Small educational projects demonstrating the implementation of classic **design patterns** in C#.

---

## Implemented Patterns

### Composite
- Demonstrates the Composite pattern for working with tree-like object structures. Includes a client that interacts with objects through a common interface.

### Observer
- Implements the Observer pattern to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects. Observers are notified automatically when the subject state changes.

### Prototype
- Demonstrates the Prototype pattern using object cloning. Shows how to create copies of objects without depending on their concrete classes.

---

## Format

Each task is implemented as a **separate C# console application**.
