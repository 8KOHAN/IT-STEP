# Design Patterns

Small educational projects demonstrating the implementation of classic **design patterns** in C#.

---

## Implemented Patterns

### Composite
Demonstrates the Composite pattern for working with tree-like object structures.
Includes a client that interacts with objects through a common interface.

### Observer
Implements the Observer pattern to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects.
Observers are notified automatically when the subject state changes.

### Prototype
Demonstrates the Prototype pattern using object cloning.
Shows how to create copies of objects without depending on their concrete classes.

---

## Purpose

This project is intended for learning and practicing design patterns in C#.
Each pattern is implemented in a simple and isolated form.

---

## Format

Each task is implemented as a **separate C# console application**.
