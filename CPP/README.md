# C++ Projects

This repository contains a collection of my C++  projects completed during my studies at IT STEP Academy.  
Each project focuses on a specific aspect of object-oriented programming, algorithms, and software development using C++.

## Covered Topics and Skills

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
  Classes, inheritance, composition, aggregation, polymorphism, and virtual methods.
  
- **Data Structures:**  
  Implementation of custom `Array`, `DoublyLinkedList`, and `Group` classes.

- **Mathematical and Logical Models:**  
  Classes such as `Drob`, `Man`, `Reservoir`, and others demonstrating encapsulation and operator overloading.

- **Practical Applications:**  
  - **Personal Finance Management System and Hangman** – a full-featured console application combining financial tracking and a mini-game.  
  - **Traffic Database**, **Overcoat and Flat**, and **Exceptions** – projects illustrating real-world data handling and error management.

- **File Operations and Streams:**  
  Reading, writing, and managing structured data using file streams.

- **Other Concepts:**  
  Type conversions, abstract classes, and work with the file system.

## Summary

Through these projects, I have developed strong skills in C++ programming, problem-solving, and software design.  
My work demonstrates a solid understanding of OOP principles, data processing, file management, and modular program structure.
