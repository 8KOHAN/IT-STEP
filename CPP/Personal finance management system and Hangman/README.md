# Personal Finance Management System and Hangman

This console-based C++ application allows users to manage their personal finances and enjoy a game as a reward.  
You can create wallets, manage debit and credit cards, track expenses, and view detailed spending statistics.  

The system supports multiple currencies — Hryvnia (₴), Dollar ($), and Euro (€) — and automatically converts prices according to the current exchange rate used in the program.  

All statistics, including a full spending history and top three purchases by day, week, and month, can be viewed directly in the console and are also automatically saved to files for future reference.  

A virtual shop lets you purchase various items — and if you buy a PS5, the classic Hangman game becomes available to play.  
The Hangman word list is securely stored in an encrypted text file, with each word encoded using a simple ASCII shift for additional protection.  

This project was developed as a coursework project at IT STEP Academy and demonstrates object-oriented programming, file handling, and modular C++ design.
