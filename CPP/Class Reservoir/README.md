# Reservoir Manager (C++ OOP Project)

This project is a object-oriented program written in C++ for managing water bodies (reservoirs). It demonstrates class design, dynamic object management, and basic console interface features.

## Features

- Create and manage multiple `Reservoir` objects
- Add new reservoirs with dimensions and type
- Delete existing reservoirs by index
- Display all reservoirs
- Compare surface areas of two reservoirs of the same type
- Automatically manage memory using `std::string` and `std::vector`
