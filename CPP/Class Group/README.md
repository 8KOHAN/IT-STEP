# Student Group Management System

## Project Description
This is a simple **console-based C++ application** designed to manage student information within a single academic group.  
The project demonstrates the use of **OOP principles** and modern C++ containers such as **`std::vector`** and **`std::string`** for safe and efficient memory management.  

## Features
- **Add Student** → Input a student’s name, age, and university, then add them to the group.  
- **Delete Student** → Remove a student by their index in the group.  
- **Display Students** → View all students with their index, name, age, and university.  
- **Dynamic Group Size** → The group automatically grows and shrinks using `std::vector`.  
- **Safe Memory Management** → No manual `new`/`delete`, memory is handled by STL containers.
