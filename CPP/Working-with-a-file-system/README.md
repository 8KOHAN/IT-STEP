# File System Operations in C++

This project contains three C++ programs that demonstrate practical file handling operations, including file comparison, content analysis, and Caesar cipher encryption.

---

### Task 1: File Comparison

Compares two text files line by line and outputs any differences.

- Reports line mismatches with full context
- Detects extra lines in either file
- Outputs result to console

### Task 2: File Statistics

Reads a text file and calculates:

- Total number of characters
- Number of lines
- Number of vowels, consonants, and digits

Writes results to a file named `stats.txt`.

### Task 3: Caesar Cipher Encryption

Encrypts the contents of a text file using a Caesar cipher (default key: 3).

- Preserves case (uppercase/lowercase)
- Non-letter characters remain unchanged
- Output is saved to `output.txt`
